# Modern-JavaScript
A coderepo for my net ninjas playlist. Used for frontend and backend development on a server. Javascript is just amazing it`s used for making awesome things in a browser like digital clocks, quizzes, chat rooms and weather applications. With a simple static website we can breathe in life of the web application using just few lines of JavaScript code. It can be used for backend using server side JavaScript using Node.js. The possibilities are endless as in making mobile application, program robots and then creating a VR game. 

This is a transcript of a video introduction to a JavaScript course. The instructor welcomes students and explains that this series of videos will cover the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and more. The course is an extract from a larger Udemy course, and the instructor encourages students to check out the full course for more advanced topics.

The instructor explains that JavaScript is an awesome language that can be used for front-end and back-end development, mobile app development, and even virtual reality experiences. They emphasize the importance of learning JavaScript and encourage students to stick with it, even if it gets challenging at times.

The instructor then introduces the text editor, VS Code, which will be used throughout the course. They explain how to install VS Code and some helpful extensions, including Live Server, which allows students to preview their websites in a browser.

The instructor explains the concept of a server and how it works, and how Live Server allows students to use their own computer as a web server to preview their websites. They demonstrate how to create an HTML file, use Emmet to speed up writing code, and preview the file in a browser using Live Server.

Finally, the instructor explains that course files will be provided for each lesson, and students can access them on a GitHub repository. They encourage students to ask questions if they need help accessing the files.

Here is a summary of the topics covered in this video:
